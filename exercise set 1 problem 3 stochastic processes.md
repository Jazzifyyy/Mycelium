# Problem 
Find the distribution of the random variables in each of the cases and find $\mathbb{P}(X \geq n)$ for $n \geq 1$.

1. $P(s) = \frac{1}{3-2s}$
2. $P(s) = \frac{1}{4-3s}$
3. Two dice are rolled. Let $X$ be the sum of the outcomes. Find the pgf of $X$. Use this pgf to calculate the probability that the sum is divisible by $3$.
4. If the pgf of a random variable $X$ is $P(s)= \frac{1}{2}e^s + \frac{1}{4}s^2+\frac{1}{4}$, find $\mathbb{P}(X \geq 2)$.

# Solution
## Part 3

The pgf of one die is given by
$$P_{X_{1}}(s)= \frac{1}{6}()$$
