# Problem
We study the *consistency* property of the least squares estimators in simple linear regression setup.

## Part a
Fix the sample size $n = 25$. Also fix two constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Generate $x_{1},\dots,x_{n} \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(25,4)$. Treat these as fixed covariates.
# Solution
```r
x <- rnorm(n=25, mean = )
```
