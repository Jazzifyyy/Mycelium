# Problem
Obtain the differential equations of the family of circles with centres on the $x$-axis.

# Solution
The equation of the circle with centre on the x-axis is given by
$$(x-h)^2 + y^2= r^2$$
where $(h,0)$ is the centre and $r$ is the radius of the circle. 

Differentiate wrt $x$ gives
$$2(x-h)+2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0.$$
Once again, 
$$2 + 2y \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2 \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 =0.$$
Thus, the required equation is
$$yy'' + y'^2 + 1=0.$$
