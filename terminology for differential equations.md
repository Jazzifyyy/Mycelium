# What is an ordinary differential equation?

An equation involving derivatives of one or more dependent variables with respect to one or more independent variables is called a _differential equation_.

Examples:
1. $\frac{dy}{dx} = x+y$. (single independent and single dependent variables)
2. $\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{dz}{dx} = xyz$. (single independent and two dependent variables)
3. $y \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + x \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0$. (two independent and single dependent variables)

If the equations contains only a single independent variable, then the equation is an _ordinary differential equation_.

# Order of a differential equation

It is the order of the highest ordered derivative in the differential equation.

# What is a linear ordinary differential equation?

A linear ordinary differential equation of order $n$, in the dependent variable $y$ and the independent variable $x$, is an equation that is in, or can be expressed in, the form:
$$a_{n}(x) \frac{d^ny}{dx^n} + a_{n-1}(x) \frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+\dots+a_{1}(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + a_{0}(x)y(x) = b(x).$$
Examples:
1. $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+ 5 \frac{dy}{dx}+6y=0.$$
2. $$\frac{d^4y}{dx^4} + x^2 \frac{d^3y}{dx^3} + \frac{x^3dy}{dx} = xe^x.$$If an ordinary differential equation cannot be expressed in the form above, then it is a non-linear ordinary differential equation.
