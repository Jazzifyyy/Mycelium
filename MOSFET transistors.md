Initially vacuum tubes - which are just fancier light bulbs - were used to present 0 and 1, and required human to turn it on and off.

Then the classic transistors opened a new world of micro digital devices. 

MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor), invented in 1959 at Bell Labs, is an improved version of classic transistors that is more suitable for digital devices, as it requires shorter switching times between 0 and 1, is more stable, consumes less power, and easier to produce.

There are also two types of MOSFETs analogous to two types of transistors: n-MOSFET and p-MOSFET. n-MOSFET and p-MOSFET are also called NMOS and PMOS transistors for short.
