A logic gate is a device that implements a boolean function with a number of inputs and outputs. 

All computer operations are built from the combination of logic gates. 

Logic gates accept only binary inputs and produce binary outputs. With a sound mathematical theory - called Boolean Algebra developed by George Boole - foundational logic gates were created.

A set of boolean functions is _functionally complete_ if this set can construct all other Boolean functions.

Charles Sanders Peirce proved that either `NOR` or `NAND` alone is enough to create all other boolean logic functions. Therefore `NOR` or `NAND` gate is enough to implement all other logic gates.

The simplest gates that a [[CMOS circuit]] can implement are `NOT` gates, which can be used to build the `NAND` gates.

(This is why the inventions of transistors, then CMOS circuit revolutionized computer industry.)
