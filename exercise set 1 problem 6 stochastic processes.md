# Problem
## Part b

A hen lays $N$ eggs, where $N \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$. Each egg hatches with probability $p$ independently. Let $K$ be the number of chicks. Find the pgf of $K$ and identify its distribution.

# Solution
## Part b

Note that 
$$K = \sum_{i=1}^N \xi_{i}$$
where $\xi_{i}$ is $1$ if the e
