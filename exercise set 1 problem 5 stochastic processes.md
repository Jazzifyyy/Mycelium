# Problem
Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that three consecutive heads (HHH) is obtained for the first time after the $k$-th toss of a coin. Find the generating function of $\{ p_{k}: k \geq 0 \}$. Compute the expected time for this to happen.
# Solution
Let $E_{k}$ denote the event that we get three consecutive heads after the $k$-th toss for the first time. Then
$$\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(E_{n}) &= \mathbb{P}(E_{n}; \epsilon_{1}=1) +  \mathbb{P}(E_{n}; \epsilon_{1}=0) \\
&= 
\end{align}$$
