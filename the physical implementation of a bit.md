A light bulb can change two states between on and off with a switch, periodically: an off means number 0, and an on means 1 - however, one problem is that such a switch requires manual intervention from a human.

To enable automatic switching, a device called _transistor_ is used. It is a resistor whose values can vary based on an input voltage value.

A bit has two states: 0 and 1. This is implemented by a transistor where Bit 0 is represented with 0 v (no electron flow), and bit 1 is +3.5 v to +5 v (electron flow).
