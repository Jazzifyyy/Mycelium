[[digital logic gates|Digital logic gates]] are built using a circuit called **CMOS** (Complementary-MOSFET) (See: [[MOSFET transistors]]) which consists of two complementary transistors - NMOS and PMOS. 

The simplest CMOS circuit is an inverter or a NOT gate.

A property of CMOS is that a $k$-input gate uses $k$ PMOS and $k$ NMOS transistors.
