We first recall that a real function $F$ may be represented geometrically by a curve $y = F(x)$ in the $xy$ plane and the value of the derivative of $F$ at $x$ may be interpreted as the slope of the curve $y = F(x)$ at $x$. 

Thus, a first-order differential equation
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$$
where $f$ is a real function, is defining the slope $f(x,y)$ of $F$ at every point $(x,y)$ at which the function $f$ is defined.

Now assume that the differential equation has a one-parameter family of solutions that can be written in the form
$$y = F(x,c)$$
where $c$ is the arbitrary constant or parameter of the family. 

This *one-parameter family of functions* is represented geometrically by a *one-parameter family of curves* in the $xy$ plane. The slopes of these curves are given by the differential equation.

The curves are also called the **intergral curves** of the differential equation.
